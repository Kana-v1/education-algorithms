Characteristics of Algorithm:

1) Input - every algorightm has an input value (0+)

2) Output - every algorithm has to generate at least 1 output value

3) Definiteness - algorithm has to produce kind of final value (sqrt(4) is not a final value)

4) Finiteness - algorithm must stop at 1 moment (server does not)

5) Efectiness - ...


Criterias of an algorithm:

1) Time

2) Space

3) Network consumption (data transfer)

4) Power consumption

5) CPU Registers (if it is low level algorithm)

Algorithm effectiveness measures

 - Time analysis:  1 simple operation (aka +, -, =) gets 1 unit of time. Algorithm x = 5 * a + 6 * b will take 4 units of time (+, 2* and =) or 1 unit of time. It depends on the level of your point of analyze


 - Space analyzes: 1 unit(word) per assigning
