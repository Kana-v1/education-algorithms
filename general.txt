Characteristics of Algorithm:

1) Input - every algorightm has an input value (0+)

2) Output - every algorithm has to generate at least 1 output value

3) Definiteness - algorithm has to produce kind of final value (sqrt(4) is not a final value)

4) Finiteness - algorithm must stop at 1 moment (server does not)

5) Efectiness - ...


Criterias of an algorithm:

1) Time

2) Space

3) Network consumption (data transfer)

4) Power consumption

5) CPU Registers (if it is low level algorithm)

Algorithm effectiveness measures

 - Time analysis:  1 simple operation (aka +, -, =) gets 1 unit of time. Algorithm x = 5 * a + 6 * b will take 4 units of time (+, 2* and =) or 1 unit of time. It depends on the level of your point of analyze


 - Space analyzes: 1 unit(word) per assigning



Huffman algorithm allows to reduce a size of the message
How does it work: 
msg: ABCADDDD

1) calculate how many times each letter occur
A - 2
B - 1
C - 1
D - 4

2) Create an algorithm from the tree
		           8
		          /  \
        	0 /    \
		        /      \
	        4        \
	      /   \       \
  	   /	    \ 1     \   1
     /	      \       \
	0  /	       2        \
	  /	      /   \       \
  /    0 /	      \ 1    \
	/	     /	        \      \
	2(A)	 1(B) 	    1(C)    4(D)

So codes:

A - 00
B - 010
C - 011
D - 1

Collect this codes to the message. And u have to send table with codes. 


Graph: 
		
	1-----2
	|     |
	|     |
	|     |
	3-----4

Spanning tree:
	
	1------2
	|
	|
	|
	3------4

There are 2 algorithms that allow to find the least cost way from the 1 graph spike to another: 

Prims - choose the least cost way that connected to exists spikes
Kruskals - choost the least cost way that does not create circular graph

Dijkstra algorithm - allows to find shortest path from one spike of a graph to another
U get the cheapest road and at the next step get the cheapest point of the last points and get new cheapest way/
