You have one or more positions 
to  Ã»ll  and  several  candidates  to  interview.  According  to  your schedule, you are 
able to interview candidates at certain time slots.  You ask the candidates  to indi- 
cate the subsets of time slots at which they are available.  How can you schedule 
the interviews so that each time slot has at most one candidate scheduled, while 
maximizing the number of candidates that you can interview?
