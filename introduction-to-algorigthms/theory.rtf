keys - the numbers to be sorted
satelite data - kets associated with other data

record - keys and satelite data together

Time to resolve divide-and-conquer issue: 

T(n) = D(n) + a * T(n/b) + C(n)
where 
D(n) - time to divide the source problem
Source problem yields a subproblems, and it takes T(n/b) time to resolve each of them
C(n) - time to assemble subsolutions

The height of the binary tree = lg(n)

asymptomatic efficiency - how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input without bound

O-notation - upper bound on the asymptomic notation


Matrix multiplication - divide-and-conquer

Open addressing - the family of methods that allow resolve hash function collisions 
get ith element from the statistics order (so you have array of distinct numbers, and you need ith element from this array in sorted view) - randomized select

index of the matrix that is stored in the single-direction array:
    - starting index = s
    - emenents in the row = n
    - elements in the column = m

row-major order: s + (n * (i - s)) + (j - s) 

M = 1 2 3   
    4 5 6   

M[1, 2] = 0 + (3 * (1 - 0)) + (2 - 0) = 5

column-major order: s + (m * (j - s)) + (i - s)

    1 4
M = 2 5
    3 6

M[1, 2] = 0 + (2 * (2 - 0)) + (1 - 0) = 5
